# Choosing a Sniper

There are three useable snipers in Warzone, the HDR, Kar 98, and AX-50.  These all come with goods and bads, and your choice depends on how you would like to play.  The Kar 98 is for someone who likes to get close to the emeny, and get lots of kills.  The HDR is for the people that want to be a true sniper, by sitting back and watchin gout for your team.  The AX-50 is the middle ground, however I do not recomend using this.

## Lininng up Your Shot

When aiming, you **always** want to take your shot as soon a possible.  The longer you take, the more time the other team has to see you.  You want to aim where you think they are going to be rather than aiming on top of them.  It will take time for you to learn how far you will have to aim, and how long it will take the bullet to hit.
